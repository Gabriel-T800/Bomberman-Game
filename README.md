# Bomberman-Game
An end-of semester project that I made with a classmate in my first semester of Computer Engineering

The purpose of the project was to make a simplified Bomberman Game.The game should have some minimum requisities (all of them included in our 1.0 version of the game), that would be evaluated together with some more core aspects of the coding, like the legibility and code logic.
The most difficult part of the project was to learn all alone the Raylib library and how to apply our intermediate C coding knowledge to the construction of the game, but was a very pleasent experience.
