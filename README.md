# Bomberman-Game
An end-of semester project that I made with a classmate in my first semester of Computer Engineering

The purpose of the project was to make a simplified Bomberman Game. The game should have some minimum requisities (all of them included in our 1.0 version of the game), that would be evaluated together with some more core aspects of the coding, like the legibility and code logic.
The most difficult part of the project was to learn all by ourselves how to use the Raylib library and how to apply our intermediate C coding knowledge to the construction of the game. I loved the opportunity to make my first game in a couple of weeks and I would say that was a very pleasent experience from beginning to end.

The "Final Project Description" is a manual of the game, so read it to know how to play, download the .c, .h, .exe and at least one of the "Mapa" files (taking care to install all of them in the same directory) and have some fun playing my game :)
