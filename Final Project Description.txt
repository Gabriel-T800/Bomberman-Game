Final Project Description: Simplified Bomberman

Authors: Gabriel Torres and Guilherme Prados

This project is a simplified version of the classic Bomberman game, developed in C using the Raylib graphics library. The goal is to provide a fun and nostalgic gaming experience with basic elements such as bomb placement, block destruction, key collection to progress through levels, and (reasonably) intelligent enemy movement.

This game was designed for academic purposes and features a simple yet functional graphical interface, ideal for exploring game programming concepts such as text and binary file manipulation, keyboard event handling, rudimentary AI for enemies, and collision management.

To play, simply open the executable file "Bomberman.exe", ensuring that you have downloaded all the necessary files.
Maps can be edited by the user before playing, allowing the creation of additional levels.

Game Controls:
Movement keys: Use the arrow keys to move the character quickly (continuous movement while holding the key) or use WSAD to move block by block (step-by-step movement).

Placing bombs: Press B to plant a bomb in front of the player, following the last recorded movement direction.
If it is not possible to place the bomb in a way that hits the desired block/enemy in front, press E + B to position the bomb at the player's current location. The bomb will not appear in this case, but it will explode normally after 3 seconds, so move away from the explosion area.

Press TAB to open the game menu, then press the corresponding letter for the desired command.

Game Mechanics:
The FPS limit is 60, with possible slight drops.

Bombs take 3 seconds to explode. The explosion occurs in a cross pattern, with a blast radius of 2 blocks in each direction, but the explosion itself does not appear on the screen.

Explosions and enemies deal damage to the player, so be cautious.

Losing more than 5 lives resets the game.

Collect 5 keys, hidden in some of the beige chests (blocks), to advance to the next level.

Enemies have full physics, preventing them from picking up keys or passing through each other.

Scoring System:
+10 points per destroyed block
+20 points per defeated enemy
+200 points for level progression
-100 points per lost life
The score does not go below 0.

Note:
If you encounter issues while running the game, check:

If all project dependency files are in the same directory.
If the compiler version is compatible with Raylib.
Enjoy the game!
